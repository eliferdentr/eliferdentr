# Hey there, this is Elif!

I am a backend engineer working with Java and Spring Boot professionally, and learning building Go backend projects in my personal time.

I enjoy building small but production-style backend tools to understand how systems behave under load and concurrency.

## Current focus

- Backend development using Go.
- Go concurrency patterns.
- REST API development

## Projects (my favourites)

- httpbin-clone → HTTP debugging service written in Go
- Finance Tracker API → REST API MVP
- Pulse → concurrent worker-pool service
- Concurrent Uptime Checker → CLI concurrency tool

## Tech
