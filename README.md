# Hey there, this is Elif 👋

I am a backend developer focused on Go, concurrency, and REST APIs.
Professionally working with Java and Spring Boot, while building Go backend and CLI tools in my personal projects.

I enjoy building small but production-style backend tools to understand how systems behave under load and concurrency.
